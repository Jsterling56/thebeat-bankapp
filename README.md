The Beat Bank:
The Beat Bank is a web application developed for our kid's ministry program that takes place on Wednesday nights at our church. The purpose of creating this page was to provide an easy way to keep track of children's good behavior and ensure that expectations are met.

Features:
Add new child: You can add children to the tracker by entering their names in the input field and clicking the "Add User" button.
Track individual balances: Each child has a dollar balance associated with their name, which represents their good behavior or accomplishments.
Increment and decrement balances: You can use the "+" and "-" buttons next to each user to increment or decrement their dollar balance by 1.
Remove Children: If needed, you can remove a child from the bank by clicking the "Remove Child" button next to their name.

Local storage: 
The app utilizes local storage to persist the user balances, ensuring that the data is saved and accessible even if the page is refreshed or reopened.

Getting Started:
To use the The Beat Bank, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The page will load with an input field to add new children and a table to display the existing users and their balances.

Usage:
Enter the name of a child in the "Child" input field.
Click the "Add Child" button to add the child to the bank.
The child's name and balance will appear in the table.
Use the "+" and "-" buttons to increment or decrement the child's balance.
To remove a child from the bank, click the "Remove Child" button next to their name.

Notes:
The Beat Bank provides a simple and visual way to track children's good behavior and encourage them to meet expectations during our Wednesday night kid's ministry program.
It is recommended to use this app on a device with a modern web browser and JavaScript enabled.
The app stores the user balances in the browser's local storage, so the data will be retained even if the page is closed or refreshed.
